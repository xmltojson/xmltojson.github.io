🌌 Excited to share my latest project: Aurora Borealis!

An interactive Northern Lights simulation built with pure HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

✨ Features:
• Realistic flowing aurora waves
• Dynamic twinkling starfield
• Random shooting stars (make a wish! 🌠)
• 8 beautiful color themes
• Fully customizable settings
• Works on any device

The best part? It runs entirely in your browser - no downloads, no installations.

Perfect for relaxation, as a screensaver, or just to enjoy the beauty of the Northern Lights from anywhere in the world.
