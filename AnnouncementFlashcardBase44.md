🚀 **Excited to announce the launch of FlashLearn — a smart flashcard app for learning English!** 🇬🇧🇺🇦

After weeks of development, I'm thrilled to share **FlashLearn** — a beautifully designed, fully functional flashcard application built to help Ukrainian speakers master English vocabulary using **science-backed spaced repetition**.

### 🎯 What makes FlashLearn special?

📚 **150 curated English words** across three CEFR levels:
- 🟢 **B1** — Everyday communication essentials
- 🟡 **B2** — Academic & professional vocabulary
- 🔴 **C1** — Advanced fluency-level words

🧠 **Spaced Repetition Algorithm (SM-2)** — The app intelligently schedules reviews so you study words right before you'd forget them. No wasted time, maximum retention.

🇺🇦 **Built for Ukrainian learners** — Full Ukrainian interface with accurate translations and contextual examples for every word.

### ✨ Key Features:

✅ **Flip-to-reveal flashcards** with smooth 3D animations
✅ **Custom deck creation** — add your own words and topics
✅ **4-level self-assessment** (Again → Hard → Good → Easy)
✅ **Learning streaks & daily goals** to keep you motivated
✅ **Detailed statistics** — track accuracy, mastery levels, and progress by CEFR level
✅ **30-day activity calendar** — visualize your consistency
✅ **Keyboard shortcuts & swipe gestures** for fast studying
✅ **Works on any device** — fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop (portrait & landscape)

### 🔐 Platform & Technical Highlights:

- **Hosted on Base44** — fast, reliable, always available
- **User authentication** — sign up, log in, and pick up right where you left off
- **Server-side storage** — your progress is safely stored in the cloud, synced across all your devices
- **Modern UI** — dark theme with gradient accents, built for comfortable long study sessions

### 📊 How It Works:

1️⃣ **Choose a deck** (B1, B2, C1, or create your own)
2️⃣ **Study cards** — see the English word, try to recall the translation
3️⃣ **Flip & rate** — honestly assess how well you knew it
4️⃣ **The algorithm adapts** — words you struggle with appear more often; words you know well are spaced out
5️⃣ **Track your progress** — watch your mastery grow over time

### 🌍 Why I built this:

Learning a language shouldn't feel like a chore. I wanted to create a tool that's **beautiful to use**, **scientifically effective**, and **specifically designed for Ukrainian speakers** learning English. Whether you're preparing for IELTS, advancing your career, or just building confidence — FlashLearn is here to help.
