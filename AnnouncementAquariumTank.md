🚀 Project Launch: Aquarium Tank

I'm thrilled to announce the release of my latest web development project - an interactive virtual aquarium built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🎯 Project Highlights:

• Pure vanilla implementation - no frameworks or dependencies
• Smooth 60 FPS CSS animations
• Local Storage API for state persistence
• Responsive design for all devices
• Clean, maintainable codebase

🛠️ Technical Features:

- Multiple animated fish with realistic swimming patterns
- Dynamic bubble generation system
- Procedural plant placement with natural swaying motion
- Layered visual effects (light rays, particles, water surface)
- Auto-save functionality

This project demonstrates that impressive interactive experiences can be built without heavy frameworks - sometimes vanilla is all you need.
